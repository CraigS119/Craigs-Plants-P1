### Design

#### Color Scheme

The color scheme chosen for this website consists of green (#1e6639) and white (#ffffff). The color green is naturally associated with plants, gardens, and positive functions such as productivity and work. A darker shade was specifically chosen to create a strong contrast with the white background. This color scheme complements images of gardens and plants, providing users with a sense of horticulture when navigating the website

#### Typography

The font used in the logo and all headings is Pacifico. This choice was made due to its handwritten style, which imparts a personal feel to the site, adding a touch of elegance rather than merely presenting information. The text font is Poppins, selected for its clarity and legibility, ensuring users can easily read paragraph text. In case the custom fonts fail to load, a fallback font of sans-serif was implemented.
